Why GitHub for your profile? Why an "Interim Profile"?
It's quick. I'm speaking at the Tri-Chapter meeting of Medical Library Association on September 27, 2016. It will take time for my new domain and website healthinfopro.net to propagate -- even if I were to build and launch it. My last day at the Health Sciences and Human Services Library at University of Maryland Baltimore will be September 30.

Contact me at kyang@healthinfopro.net -- the email address is active even if my new website is not yet!
